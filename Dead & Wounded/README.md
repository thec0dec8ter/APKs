# Dead & Wounded

A "fun to play" number game.

This game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.

At the beginning of the game, a 4-digit number is secretly generated by the computer. Each of the digits will be unique(i.e different from other digits). 


The objective of the game is to logically find the secret number by using hints given to you whenever you try to input the secret number.

Hints will be displayed in this format:
<br>"x" dead and "y" wounded</br>
<br>"x" dead => denotes that (x) digits are in the same position in your number as in the secret number.</br>
<br>"y" wounded => denotes that (y) digits are part of the secret number but they aren't in their right positions.</br>

Example:
<ul>
<li>Secret number: 4271</li>
<li>Your try: 1234</li>
<li>Hint: 1 dead and 2 wounded. (The dead is "2", the wounded are "4" and "1".) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Secret number: 4271</li>
<li>Your try: 2140</li>
<li>Answer: 0 dead and 3 wounded. (No number is in it's right position, the wounded are "4", "1" and "2".) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Secret number: 4271</li>
<li>Your try: 4271</li>
<li>Answer: 4 dead and 0 wounded. (All numbers are correct and in their right positions).YOU WIN!</li>
</ul>
You must correctly find the computer's secret number before the allocated number of trials is exhausted<br>
Basic Tips :
<ul>
<li>All four digits are different</li>
<li>Secret number cannot begin with 0</li>
</ul>
Goodluck. :thumbsup:
